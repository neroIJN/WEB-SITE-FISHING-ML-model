Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using machine learning models. We analyze a dataset that categorizes websites into legitimate, phishing, or suspicious based on various features. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset Details
Total Instances: 1353
Categories:
Legitimate websites (1) â†’ 548 instances
Phishing websites (-1) â†’ 702 instances
Suspicious websites (0) â†’ 103 instances
The dataset contains no missing values, making it ideal for direct analysis and modeling.

Features
Key website attributes analyzed include:

SFH (Server Form Handler)
popUpWindow
SSLfinal_State (SSL certificate validation)
Request_URL
URL_of_Anchor
web_traffic
URL_Length
age_of_domain
having_IP_Address
These features help determine whether a website is safe or malicious.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:
âœ… Preprocess and analyze the dataset
âœ… Train machine learning models for phishing website detection
âœ… Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

Machine Learning Models Used
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Implementation
ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing: Data normalization and feature engineering
ðŸ”¹ Model Training: Applying SVM and Random Forest to classify websites
ðŸ”¹ Evaluation: Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Results & Findings
The trained models effectively classify websites as legitimate, phishing, or suspicious based on the extracted features. Further optimization can be done using hyperparameter tuning.

ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements:

Add deep learning techniques for improved accuracy
Implement real-time phishing detection integration
Expand dataset for better generalization
